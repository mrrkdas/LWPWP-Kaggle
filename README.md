# LWPWP-Kaggle
Kaggle Competition where, the goal of this competition is to predict overall writing quality.


# Overview
The goal of this competition is to predict overall writing quality. Does typing behavior affect the outcome of an essay? You will develop a model trained on a large dataset of keystroke logs that have captured writing process features.

Your work will help explore the relationship between learners’ writing behaviors and writing performance, which could provide valuable insights for writing instruction, the development of automated writing evaluation techniques, and intelligent tutoring systems.

# Description

It’s difficult to summarize the complex set of behavioral actions and cognitive activities in the writing process. Writers may use different techniques to plan and revise their work, demonstrate distinct pause patterns, or allocate time strategically throughout the writing process. Many of these small actions may influence writing quality. Even so, most writing assessments focus on only the final product. Data science may be able to uncover key aspects of the writing process.
Past research explored a number of process features related to behaviors such as pausing, additions or deletions, and revisions. However, previous studies have used relatively small datasets. Additionally, only a small number of process features have been studied.
Competition host Vanderbilt University is a private research university in Nashville, Tennessee. It offers 70 undergraduate majors and a full range of graduate and professional degrees across 10 schools and colleges, all on a beautiful campus—an accredited arboretum—complete with athletic facilities and state-of-the-art laboratories. Together with ​The Learning Agency Lab, an independent nonprofit based in Arizona, Vanderbilt is optimized to inspire and nurture cross-disciplinary research that fosters discoveries that have global impact.
Your work in this competition will use process features from keystroke log data to predict overall writing quality. These efforts may identify relationships between learners’ writing behaviors and writing performance. Additionally, given that most current writing assessment tools mainly focus on the final written products, this may help direct learners’ attention to their text production process and boost their autonomy, metacognitive awareness, and self-regulation in writing.
